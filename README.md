## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application
- `mistral_client.py`: Client for interacting with Mistral AI API
- `ppt_generator.py`: PowerPoint generation using python-pptx
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Key Components

### PPT Generator

The PowerPoint generator takes structured content from the AI and creates visually appealing slides with proper formatting, including:

- Title slides
- Section headers
- Content slides with bullet points
- Closing slides

### Mistral AI Integration

The application uses Mistral AI's large language model to:

- Parse user input for presentation requirements
- Structure content into logical sections
- Generate detailed bullet points
- Create a cohesive presentation flow


### AI Image Generation

- AgentAI and Restack API integration for generating relevant images for each slide.
- Images maintain 16:9 aspect ratio and are placed in visually balanced positions.

### Voice Input & Document Analysis

- Voice recordings are transcribed using Google's speech recognition
- Document analysis extracts content from various file formats to enhance presentations
